Sales distribution across customer segments (e.g., consumer, corporate, home office, though specific segments are not detailed).
Overall sales performance metrics.

6.  Underperforming Products
Some products show losses or limited regional presence:

Fellowes PB500 Electric Punch Plastic Comb Binding Machine with Manual Bind:
Total Profit: $7,753.04
Central: -$1,525.19 (significant loss)
East: $2,414.88
South: $3,812.97 (highest regional profit for this product)
West: $3,050.38

 Products Sold in Single Regions:
"3D Systems Cube Printer, 2nd Generation, Magenta": $3,717.97 (East only)
"Zebra ZM400 Thermal Label Printer": $3,343.54 (East only)
Insight: The Fellowes PB500’s loss in the Central region suggests it may be unprofitable to sell there, while single-region products could represent either niche successes or missed opportunities for broader distribution.

Recommendations:

1. Investigate and Address Losses
Action: Examine why products like the "Fellowes PB500" incur losses in the Central region (e.g., high costs, low demand, or pricing issues). Consider discontinuing unprofitable products in specific regions or adjusting strategies to improve margins.

2. Expand Successful Products
Action: Products like the "3D Systems Cube Printer" and "Zebra ZM400 Thermal Label Printer" are profitable in the East. Test their potential in other regions (e.g., West or South) to boost overall profits. Similarly, explore introducing the "Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier" to the South.

3. Tailor Regional Marketing Strategies
Action:
South: Leverage the high average sales ($241.80) by promoting premium products, bundle deals, or upselling to maximize revenue per sale.
Central: With the lowest average sales ($215.77), focus on increasing sales volume through discounts, promotions, or introducing higher-value products.
East: Maintain the strong profitability ($30,314.80) by reinforcing successful product lines and optimizing inventory.
